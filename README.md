# Logging Package

The Logging package represents the main entry point of the OmegaCMS. It manages the logging's
lifecycle, including configuration, routing and handling HTTP requests.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.2 or later

## Installation via Composer

Add `"omegacms/logging": "^1.0.0"` to the require block in your `composer.json` file and then run `composer install`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omegacms/logging": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the following from the command line:

```sh
composer require omegacms/logging "^1.0.0"
```

If you want to include the test sources, use:

```sh
composer require --prefer-source omegacms/logging "^1.0.0"
